# Abstract

A simple orchestrator that takes an adjacency matrix as input.

This orchestrator acts as a webservice.
This means that you send a representation of your graph and nodes via an HTTP POST request to the engine, and:

* It decomposes the workflow
* Launch as many "processes" (actually goroutines) as nodes (see performances)
* Launch a conductor that acts as a communication vector for the running nodes

OaaS is micro service oriented. Which means that it does not actually run the artifact of the node. Instead, It calls another web service that acts as a proxy for the execution task. The proxy may implement drivers as needed, such as a `shell` driver, an `ansible` driver, `docker`, ...

The concurrency is implemented thanks to go routines (See this [post](http://blog.owulveryck.info/2015/12/02/orchestrate-a-digraph-with-goroutine-a-concurrent-orchestrator/) for more information about the implementation)

# Architecture

## orchestrator

The orchestrator is the main web service. It is a cloud native, stateless application. Its goal is simply to orchestrate/schedule the tasks so they are executed concurently in the correct order.

## executor(s)

The executor is a web service that actually executes a task.

## The Gorch

`gorch` is the Graphical-Orchestration representation.

It is a JSON representation of the graph.

It is composed of and adjaceny matrix and a list of nodes.

```JSON
{
    "name": "string",
    "state": 0,
    "digraph": [
        0
    ],
    "nodes": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "state": 0,
            "name": "string",
            "engine": "string",
            "artifact": "string",
            "args": [
                "string"
            ]
        }
    ]

}
```

# Getting it up and running

## Grab and compile
The engine is written in pure go. The package is go-gettable. Assuming you have a GO environment up and running, the following tasks should be enough to enjoy the orchestrator:

* `go get github.com/owulveryck/gorchestrator`
* `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/owulveryck/gorchestrator`
* `make dist` This will create a complete distribution for your system in the `dist` subfolder

## Run

Executor and Orchestrator are by default talking to each other in https, and are using mutual authentication.
Demo certificates for localhost should have been generated if you ran the `make dist` command.

### Running the orchestrator

Simply go to the ./dist/*/*/orchestrator and run `./orchestrator`

#### Running the executor

go to the ./dist/*/*executor and run `./executor`

### Running a sample

Then you can post a query as described in the example folder:

```shell
# curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d @example.json -k http://localhost:8080/v1/tasks
```

# Logging

Logging is a work in progress. The [logrus](github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) framework in used to perform logging
by default it logs on stdout (with a colored output if it's running on a terminal). 

You can configure two additionnal hooks:
* syslog to log to a local/remote syslog
* logstash to log to a logstash instance (and use the ELK suite to see what happens)


# API

The REST API is in developement but nearly stable. It is self documented with swagger. 

## Apidoc

The api doc is viewable

* live [here](http://blog.owulveryck.info/gorchestrator/swagger/) for api documentation.
* In your own instance at [http://localhost:8080/apidocs/](http://localhost:8080/apidocs/)

# Clients
 
## Webclient

A web client is in development, see _clients/web_ for the sources:
![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owulveryck/gorchestrator/master/Documentation/images/webclient.png)

## Tosca client

A tosca client using the [toscalib](https://github.com/owulveryck/toscalib) is present in _clients/tosca_.
It converts a TOSCA execution plan into a _gorch_ representation.

## Online Demo

TODO Soon
# CI

The service TRAVIS is used to test the current release. The current build status is :
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/owulveryck/gorchestrator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/owulveryck/gorchestrator)

## What is tested

* The basic tests of all the gorchestrator's packages
* a [go vet](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) on all the gorchestrator's packages
* race condition detection (using the [go race detector](http://blog.golang.org/race-detector)) on all the gorchestrator's packages
